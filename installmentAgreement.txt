IRS Fresh Start Installment Agreement Program
Input/Output Analysis

	•	Introduction Information to Include on Website

You can avoid unnecessary penalties and interest by paying your taxes in full and on time. This website may allow you [or your authorized representative (Power of Attorney)] to apply for an installment agreement if you cannot pay your taxes in full.

[SSJ:  Should we include a general overview of the requirements to be eligible for the program or not?  (See IRS website summary - http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Fresh-Start-Installment-Agreements).  May not want to so that we can first collect taxpayer info database.

IV.	Questions For Thought.

	•	Should we attempt to address situation where CSED < 72 months? SSJ: Yes. Let’s discuss.
	•	What other “database information” should we gather that is not necessarily vital to prepare Form 9456?
	•	SSJ:  I tried to go through the IRS’s online streamline installment agreement, but could not since I do not have any information to enter.  
	•	Do we have anyone we know of that has received a notice or owes taxes that we could use as a “test case” to walk through the IRS’s questionnaire/prompts??  
	•	Based on what I was able to get through on the IRS website, we should consider whether we should add/incorporate any of the following questions which are on the IRS’s website.  https://sa2.www4.irs.gov/irfof/lang/en/eiaTPstatus.jsp
	•	My Status
	•	Confirm your present status by selecting one option:
	•	I am the taxpayer
	•	I filed a tax return and have received a notice from the IRS.
	•	I filed a tax return, owe taxes, and have not received a notice from the IRS.
	•	My return has been examined and I owe tax.
	•	I am an authorized Power of Attorney (POA)
	•	My client filed a tax return and has received a notice from the IRS.
	•	My client filed a tax return, owes taxes, and has not received a notice from the IRS.
c.	My client's return has been examined and owes tax
