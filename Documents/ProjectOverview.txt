Project Overview

Key:
User - refers to the person using our web application. Can be an individual or a group.
Process - refers to the process of filling out the Document
Document - refers to the PDF that is being generated
# = comment, nothing formal, personal thoughts or guides to delinate sections
() - similar to a comment but more formal
* = footnote. Additional footnotes would be met with a *1, *2, etc.

# Excuse the minimal document. It is meant to be easily editable in all platforms, especially the command line for me and rapidly changing.

# I suggest using a #(first letter of your first name) to personalize the 
  comments in any situations where it would be useful.
