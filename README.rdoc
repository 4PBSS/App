== README

This site will contain everything for our project. For now it is fine that it is a public directory because there won't be anything of value in the code. As I get further in the process we will want to make this private.

Please take the time to download the Application to be able to publish to this site via the "Clone in Desktop" button to the right. This will allow us to add files to the project and leave each other notes. You will notice above most of the folders say "Inital commit" but the Documents folder says "Added Documents folder to contain all documentation". Each time a file is added you have the opportunity to add a descriptive note of what the addition / change was. 

Navigate into the Documents folder and review the ProjectOverview.txt. Please make additons / leave comments and add the file back to the site. This process may be odd at first but it will be much more streamlined for keeping project communication in order. We won't have to worry that you have the "latest version" of the documentation because it will just be a constantly edited version if you will.

If there are any questions just give me a call at 859-585-6699.
